# Binary Tool

## Overview
The Binary Tool is a collection of Python scripts that facilitate various operations involving binary data. From simple conversions to more complex functionalities like encryption and image processing, this tool offers a versatile set of utilities for manipulating binary data.

## Features
1. **Binary Converter:** Convert text data into binary representation and vice versa.
2. **Binary File Analysis:** Analyze binary files to extract metadata, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.
3. **Image Processing:** Perform basic operations on binary image data, such as resizing, filtering, and edge detection.
4. **Steganography:** Encode and decode secret messages within binary data, providing a covert communication mechanism.
5. **Input/output Processing:** Implement basic binary input and output algorithms using binary manipulation techniques.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library, for steganography)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the Python scripts.
2. Install the required dependencies:

python binary_converter.py
python binary_processor.py
python image_processor.py
python steganography_tool.py
python encryption_tool.py

## Scripts
1. **binary_converter.py**: Convert text data into binary representation and vice versa.
2. **binary_processor.py**: Process binary data, including counting ones, decoding binary to text, etc.
3. **image_processor.py**: Perform basic image processing operations on binary image data.
4. **steganography_tool.py**: Encode and decode secret messages within image files using LSB steganography.
5. **encryption_tool.py**: Implement basic encryption and decryption using binary manipulation techniques.

## Example
Suppose you want to encode a secret message into an image file using steganography:
1. Run `steganography_tool.py`.
2. Choose the option to encode a message.
3. Enter the path to the image file and the message to encode.
4. The encoded image will be saved, containing the hidden message.

To decrypt the message from the encoded image:
1. Run `steganography_tool.py`.
2. Choose the option to decode a message.
3. Enter the path to the encoded image file.
4. The hidden message will be revealed.
